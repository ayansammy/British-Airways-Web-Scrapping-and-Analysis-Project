Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

# Objective
As a data scientist at BA, it will be your job to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

# Analysis
**Sentiment Analysis**

Overview

- In the initial phase of my analysis, I conducted sentiment analysis on customer reviews to gauge the overall sentiment towards British Airways. The sentiment scores were derived using the TextBlob library in Python. This library provides a simple and intuitive way to analyze the sentiment of text data, assigning polarity scores to indicate the positivity or negativity of the content. Additionally, the analysis includes subjectivity scores, which measure the degree of objectivity or subjectivity in the reviews. The sentiment scores were then used to categorize each review into one of three categories: 'Positive,' 'Neutral,' or 'Negative,' based on the polarity scores.

## Topic Modeling Using CountVectorizer and LatentDirichletAllocation
*Text vectorization**
- This is the process of converting textual data into a numerical representation, allowing machine learning algorithms to work with text. It involves transforming text documents into feature vectors. We will be using Count Vectorizer to perform this operation.
**CountVectorizer**
- This is a feature extraction technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to convert text data into numerical feature vectors. It is a part of the scikit-learn library in Python. CountVectorizer operates by tokenizing text documents, converting them into a matrix of token counts.
**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**
- LDA is often categorized as a topic modeling technique, it can also be considered a form of feature engineering. It processes the features created by CountVectorizer (or another vectorizer) to discover the underlying topics in a text corpus. In doing so, it generates a new set of features related to the topics within the documents. Each document is then described by its distribution of topics, and each topic is characterized by its distribution of words. These topic distributions can be used as features in downstream tasks, such as document classification, clustering, or as part of a recommendation system.

## Topic Modeling Results
**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**
I applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify underlying topics within the customer reviews.
**Identified Topics:**
- Topic #1: class, flight, food, good, seat, ba, business, service, crew, seats
- Topic #2: flight, ba, tokyo, british, airways, tour, service, crew, heathrow, lhr
